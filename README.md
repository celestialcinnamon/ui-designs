# ui-designs

This repository contains UI designs from various places (dribbble, CollectUI, Behance, magazines, etc.) that I try to replicate in my free time. I did not come up with the designs, except for the ones with asterisks. I merely took images and concept designs and coded them into HTML and CSS (and sometimes with JavaScript).
