        Total&shy;ly Legit Title for This Art&shy;icle
      </h1>
      <p>
        Sorry, I had to use Lady Gaga's photos from her album ARTPOP be&shy;cause I
        have no in&shy;ter&shy;net while I was do&shy;ing this, and they're the on&shy;ly ones I had
        in my stash. As you can see, I'm a huge La&shy;dy Ga&shy;ga fan. I mean, pro&shy;bably
        not as huge as other peo&shy;ple, I never had the chance to go to one of her
        tours, but I love her so much, e&shy;nough for me to be shame&shy;less in u&shy;sing
        her in my de&shy;mo pro&shy;jects lol.
      </p>
