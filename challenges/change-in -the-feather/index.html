                I stand here wai&shy;ting for you to bang the gong to crash the cri&shy;tics sa&shy;ying "Is it right or is it wrong?" If only fame had an I&shy;V, ba&shy;by could I bear. Be&shy;ing a&shy;way from you I found the vein, put it in here. I live for the ap&shy;plause. I live for the way that you cheer and scream for me. I live for your ap&shy;plause. Give me that thing that I love; put your hands up, make them touch. Make them real loud.
            </p>

                I wan&shy;na hold them like they do in Te&shy;xas plays. Fold them, let them hit me, raise it, baby, stay with me. I love it. Love game in&shy;tu&shy;i&shy;tion played the cards with spades to start. And af&shy;ter he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on his heart.

                I'm gon&shy;na mar&shy;ry the night. I won't give up in my life. I'm a war&shy;ri&shy;or queen; I'll live pas&shy;sion&shy;ate&shy;ly tonight. I'm gon&shy;na mar&shy;ry the dark. I'm gon&shy;na make love to the stars. I'm a sol&shy;dier to my own emp&shy;ti&shy;ness. I am a win&shy;ner. I'm gon&shy;na mar&shy;ry the night. I'm not go&shy;ing to cry any&shy;more. I'll leave no&shy;thing on these streets to ex&shy;plore.
            </p>
            <p>
                There ain't no reason you and me should be alone tonight. I've got a reason that you're who should take me home tonight. I need a man who thinks it's right when it's so wrong tonight. It isn't hell if everybody knows my name tonight. It's hard to feel the rush to brush the dangerous. I'm gonna run back to the edge with you where we could both fall far in love. I'm on the edge of glory, and I'm hanging on a moment with you. I'm hanging on a moment of truth, I'm on the edge with you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wish I could have said goodbye. I would have said what I wanted to, maybe even cried for you. If I knew it would be the last time, I would have broke my heart in two trying to save a part of you. I don't want to feel another touch. I don't want to start another fire. I don't want to know another kiss. I want no other name falling off my lips. I don't want to give my heart away to another stranger, or let another day begin. I won't even let the sunlight in. No, I'll never love again.

                We are the crowd. We are coming out. I have got my flash on; it's true. I need that picture of you. It's so magical; we'd be so fantastical. Leather and jeans, garage glamorous&mdash;not sure what that means, but this photo of us doesn't have a price. Get ready for those flashing lights. Because you know that I am your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me. There's no other superstar, you know that I'll be your paparazzi. Promise, I'll be kind. But I won't stop until that boy is mine. You'll be famous, I'll chase you down until you love me. I'm your paparazzi.

                I've had a little bit too much. All of the people start to rush. A dizzy twister dance, I can't find my drink or man. Where are my keys? I've lost phone. What's going on the floor? I love this record but I can't see straight anymore. Keep it cool. What's the name of this club? I can't remember but it's alright. Just dance. It's gonna be okay. Spin that record, babe.

                Some girls won't dance to the beat of the track. She won't walk away but she won't look back. She looks good but her boyfriend says she's a mess. Now the girl is stressed. That baby loves to dance in the dark, but when he's looking, she falls apart.
            </p>

                I confess, I am lost in the age of the social. On our knees, we take the test to be loving and grateful. Shots were fired on the street by the church where we used to meet. Angel down, angel down! But the people just stood around. I'm a believer; it's a trial&mdash;foolish and weaker&mdash;it's chaos. Where are our leaders? I'd rather save an angel down.

                Everybody's gotta love each other. Stop throwing stones at your sisters and your brothers. Man, it wasn't that long ago we were all living in the jungle. So why do we gotta put each other down when there's more than enough love to come around? Come to mama, tell me who hurt you. There's gonna be no future if we don't figure this out.
