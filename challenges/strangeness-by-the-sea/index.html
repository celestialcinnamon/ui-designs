        <h1>Strangeness by the Sea</h1>
        <p>I don't real&shy;ly know what's in here so I'm gon&shy;na put some fil&shy;ler text. It's in the il&shy;lus&shy;tra&shy;tion but I can't real&shy;ly see it be&shy;cause of crap&shy;py qua&shy;li&shy;ty of the i&shy;mage I got from Pin&shy;ter&shy;est. Sor&shy;ry a&shy;bout that.</p>
        <p>Same goes for this one. I am real&shy;ly sor&shy;ry a&shy;bout that, but I'm gon&shy;na fill this with text that's to&shy;tal&shy;ly ir&shy;re&shy;le&shy;vant with seas.</p>
